I got busy with interviews for a bit. Unfortunately no offers yet. :(

Anyways, a couple updates.

**I'm putting the differentiable programming series on hold for now.** 

I already have the next parts drafted. However, I'm not satisfied yet with how to organize them to keep the series consistent. Another issue is that I was studying and sourcing from 2-3 projects, and this one project had a somewhat convoluted code base. The noise from this code base interfered with my overall understanding. I decided to step away from the series for a bit to let the ideas settle.

On another note, I continue studying functional programming (FP). This **will remain a ubiquitous focus**.

This passion project has been ongoing for 12+ months. For the most part I used PureScript, but recently I felt comfortable enough to revisit the Haskell core libraries and toolchains. The goal is to parse out and generalize the common features to bolster my understanding. The nice thing about Haskell is that it has a very well established community, which means a deeper substrate of dev tools. The Haskell LSP support is simply much better. For example, after setting up LSP in your editor, you can hover on the `do` notation and check for the output's context. If you use Vim/NeoVim, take a look at [haskell-tools](https://github.com/mrcjkb/haskell-tools.nvim) for a streamlined IDE experience.

In the process, I uncovered a fragile point in my foundation. Not understanding *applicatives* finally caught up to me. I glossed over and covered up this type of functor and jump right into monads from way back, because I didn't want to be stuck in the beginner's hell (which is especially deep and unforgiving for FP). Unfortunately, the lack of understanding blocked me from truly breaking through to more advanced concepts like transformers.

I allocated some time last week to address this issue. I am ready to continue now.

That being said, working with FP is definitely tedious. You need to have an affinity for details in order to enjoy it. It *must* be this way though, because *correctness* is the goal. It is better to pay a large up-front cost *now* than having non-linearly large issues blown up in my face further down the line, Ã  la [billion-dollar mistake](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12427069). It is indeed a lot of effort, but it has been paying off handsomely. Knowing FP has opened my eyes to many cool new topics. In fact, the differentiable programming series was born, in part, out of my struggle with FP. :)


I also **started experimenting with [Claude](https://claude.ai/) last week to iterate a few project ideas**. I have two goals: to refresh my TypeScript, and to explore the useful patterns of React hooks. There were some mistakes in Claude's generated code, but they are ignorable. I care about the logical patterns, and I have got what I wanted.

Finally, I am also considering migrating this blog to a new framework. I am debating between React vs Halogen. Halogen will be a fun challenge; it will directly feed into my FP foundation. On the other hand, React will be very fast with Claude. I need to think more about this.

That's all I have for now. Until next time.

Take care.
