I got busy with interviews for a bit. Unfortunately no offers yet. :(

Anyways, a couple updates.

**I'm putting the differentiable programming series on hold for now.** 

I already have the next parts drafted and planned. However, I am not yet satisfied with how to organize them so as to keep the series consistent. Another issue is that I was studying and sourcing from 2-3 projects, and this one project had a somewhat convoluted code-base, which kind of interfered with my overall understanding. I decided that I need some time away from the series to smooth things out.

On another note, I continue studying functional programming (FP). This **will remain a large focus** for a while.

This passion project has been ongoing for the past 12 months -- with a period of focused study beginning in January and lasted for a few months. I have mostly used PureScript to study, but recently I finally felt comfortable enough to revisit the Haskell core libraries. I learn laterally, so I need to be able rotate ideas around and poke at them using different tools.

My goal is to parse out and generalize the common features to bolster my understanding of FP. The nice thing about Haskell is that it has a very well established community. The LSP support is simply much better than PureScript. For example, after setting up LSP, you can hover on the `do` notation and check for the output's context. There are more QoL tools as well. Check out [haskell-tools](https://github.com/mrcjkb/haskell-tools.nvim) for a streamlined IDE integration with NeoVim.

Anyways, in the process, I discovered a fragile point in my foundation. Not understanding *applicatives* finally caught up to me. I glossed over this type of functor and jumped right into monads from way back, because I didn't want to be stuck in the beginner's hell (which is especially deep and unforgiving for FP). Unfortunately, the lack of understanding blocked me from truly breaking through to the advanced concepts such as monad transformers.

I allocated some time last week to address this issue. I am ready to continue now.

That being said, working with FP is tedious. But it *must* be this way, because *correctness* is the goal. Better to pay a large up-front cost now than having non-linearly large issues blown up in my face further down the line, a la [the billion-dollar mistake of `null`](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12427069). It's a lot of effort for sure, but it's been paying off handsomely. Knowing FP has opened my eyes to many cool new topics. In fact, the differentiable programming series was born, in part, out of my struggle with FP. :)


One final thing, I **started experimenting with [Claude](https://claude.ai/) last week to iterate a couple projects**. I have two goals: to refresh my React and TypeScript, and to explore the useful patterns of React hooks. So far it's been really helpful and enjoyable. 

I am still deciding on which framework to migrate this blog to. I am considering between React vs Halogen. Halogen will be a fun challange; it will directly feed into my understanding of FP. On the other hand, React will be very fast with Claude. I need to think more about this.

That's all I have for now. Until next time.
