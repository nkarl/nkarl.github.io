I have wanted to start a blog for a while, but kept delaying for many reasons.

One is that I have been writing in private for years using Markdown with custom embedded HTML and CSS. I am so used to this style that it feels really restricted using anything else. I need a blog template which supports those features and is easy to spin up and deploy with GitHub Actions. I was looking at Svelte but it seemed a bloated at a glance, which is quite a funny thing to say because Svelte *does* address the bloatness of React.

Now, there is nothing wrong with Svelte. It is a great framework actually. Svelte excels at building full-fledge web applications, but it is overkill for my purpose. My use case is very narrow: a simple blog. One day I stumbled upon Astro. It is a static site generator, which is the perfect tool for the job.

Now that I have a blog again, I will publish consistently.

Looking forward to all ahead!

As token of celebration, here is a `Hello World!` in PureScript. ðŸ˜€

```haskell
import Prelude
import Effect (Effect)
import Effect.Console (log)

hello :: String
hello = "Hello World!"

main :: Effect Unit
main = do
    log $ hello
```
