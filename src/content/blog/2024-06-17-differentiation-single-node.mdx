Today, we'll work out the process of differentiating a simple function.

This is the base case for a computation graph. Once we have the base case, we can look forward to the inductive case, and then generalize for more complex functions.

## Examples

We start with the simplest function: $id(x)$.

This function takes an input value and returns the same value; hence $id$ -- short for the identity function.

It doesn't do anything interesting, but it is an excellent entry point into understanding how to implement differentiation programmatically. Later, we will add more complexity by increasing the number of inputs in two other functions:

- $add(x,y)$
- $mul(x,y)$

We will also see that there is a pattern to them. Let's get started.

### 1. Id

First, we define our function $f$ and its derivative $f'$:
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= id(x) &= x\\
f'(x) &= dx &= 1
\end{align*}
$$

Let's take a moment to get familiar with the components of the diagram below.

<div style="display:block;text-align:center">
<Image
    src={nodeId}
    alt="computation node for the function Id."
    width="480"
    height="720"
/>
</div>

- The components:
    - <span style="background:#97BEEE">&nbsp;Node&nbsp;</span>, <span style="background:#F4C111">&nbsp;Forward&nbsp;</span> chain, <span style="background:#26A169">&nbsp;Reverse&nbsp;</span> chain
- The game rules for constructing the graph:
    - at each node, we define
        - the forward function to compute $id(x)$
        - the reverse function to compute its derivative

```python
@dataclass
class Node:
    def f  (self):   # the forward function
        return self

    def f_ (self):   # the reverse function
        return Value(1)
```

<p/>

### 2. Add 

The binary operator $(+)$ requires 2 parameters. So, we add one more input $y$ in this example. We define our function $f$ and its derivative $f'$:
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x,y) &= add(x,y) &= x + y\\
f'(x,y) &= d_xf + d_yf &= 1 + 1
\end{align*}
$$

Let's take a moment to get familiar with the components of the diagram below.

<div style="display:block;text-align:center">
<Image
    src={nodeAdd}
    alt="computation node for the function Add."
    width="480"
    height="720"
/>
</div>

```python
@dataclass
class Node:
    def f  (self, other: Value):
        return  self.data + other.data

    def f_ (self):
        return 2
```

<p/>

### 3. Mul

Finally, let's look at the example for $mul(x,y)$. This is also a binary operator. We define our function $f$ and its derivative $f'$:
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x,y) &= mul(x,y) &= x \times y\\
f'(x,y) &= d_xf + d_yf &= y + x
\end{align*}
$$

Let's take a moment to get familiar with the components of the diagram below. Notice that other than the name difference and the polymorphic $f$ and $f'$, the form of the graph is identical to $add(x,y)$.

<div style="display:block;text-align:center">
<img
    src={nodeMul.src}
    style="width:500px;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" 
    alt="Holy marina wacking the foolish head of a devil."
/>
</div>


```python
@dataclass
class Node:
    def f  (self, other: Value):
        return  self.data * other.data

    def f_ (self):
        return self.data + other.data
```
<p/>

## Finally

To evaluate the computation graph for each case, we invoke the forward and reverse functions, respectively. We gain two results:

- the result of $f$
- its derivative $f'$

Because there is only one node in each of these graphs, we are done.

Notice the blue line in the middle of the last two diagrams. Imagine you print out the diagram on a piece of paper. You fold the piece of paper along the blue line. You will see that the nodes in the top-half superimpose the nodes in the bottom-half: $x$ together with $dx$, and $y$ with $dy$.

We use a single graph to evaluate both *a function* and *its derivative*.

Because this graph has only one node, the derivative components are discarded output. However, we will see that the member functions *forward* and *reverse* can be expanded to do more work, making use of the derivative components. They will let us model the Chain Rule for more complex functions.

Until next time.
