The 4th string snapped a while back, but I got too busy (and lazy) to replace it. I had not been playing for half a year so when I did a quick improvisation, the string vibration gave me goosebumps. It was a pretty cool feeling.

I decided to practice the song "MÃ¹a Thu Cho Em" seriously this time.

I am alternating between the guitar and the keyboard for practicing. Switching instruments noticeably makes the song more whole. I noticed dimensions I didn't realize were there before. Interesting.
