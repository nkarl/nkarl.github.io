The 4th string snapped a while back, but I got too busy (and lazy) to replace it. I had not been playing for half a year so when I did a quick improvisation, the string vibration squeezed my heart a little bit. It was a nice feeling.

I decided to practice the song “Mùa Thu Cho Em” seriously this time.

I am alternating between the guitar and the keyboard for practicing. Switching instruments seems to make the song more whole.
