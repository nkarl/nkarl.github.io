I switched to MDX for new posts so that Mermaid diagrams and $\LaTeX$ notations can be rendered properly.

I also recently started modeling the elementary types and functions of the [MiniTorch project](https://github.com/minitorch/minitorch). I was looking for some graphing tools to visualize class dependencies. I found a few. Among them is a beautiful diagraming tool at https://whimsical.com.

I really like the flat design. Definitely a great tool for presenting.

It does not support gerating graphs from code though. That's a bummer. For development work, I will stick with more caveman stuff like Mermaid, PlantUML and Graphviz.

I test out an embedded diagram below.
