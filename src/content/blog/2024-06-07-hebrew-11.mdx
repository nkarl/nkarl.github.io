Let's try to parse and translate a verse from the Letter of St. Paul to the Hebrews. We will do just [one verse, Hebrews 11:1](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/hebrews/11-1.htm).

### Premise

$$
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{
\acute{E}\sigma\tau\iota\nu
\quad \delta\grave{\epsilon}
\quad %% pistis
    \pi\acute{\iota}\sigma\tau\iota\varsigma}_{\text{Now, faith is}}\\

%% elpizomenohn
&\underbrace{\acute{\epsilon}\lambda\pi\iota\zeta{o}\mu\acute{\epsilon}\nu\omega\nu}_{T_1}
    \quad %% hypostasis
    \underbrace{\acute{\upsilon}\pi\acute{o}\sigma\tau\alpha\sigma\iota\varsigma}_{S_1} ,\\
%% pragmaton
&\underbrace{\pi\rho\alpha\gamma\mu\acute{\alpha}\tau\omega\nu}_{T_2}
    \quad %% elenchos
    \underbrace{\acute{\epsilon}\lambda\epsilon\gamma\chi{o}\varsigma}_{S_2}
    \quad
    \underbrace{{o}\acute{\upsilon}}_{\text{not}}
    \quad
    \underbrace{\beta\lambda\epsilon\pi{o}\mu\acute{\epsilon}\nu\omega\nu}_{\text{being seen}}.
\end{align*}
$$

<p/>

This statement can be rephrased as:
$$
\mathbf{F} = S_1(T_1) \quad\wedge\quad S_2(T_2, T_3)
$$

Where:
```mermaid
graph RL
T1[T1: elpizomenohn]
T2[T2: pragmatohn]
T3[T3: ou blepomenohn]
S1[S1: hypostasis] --> AND
S2[S2: elegkhos] --> AND
AND --> Faith[F: pistis]
T1 --> S1
T2 --> S2
T3 --> S2
```

#### Therefore,

- $S_1$: under-standing (the ground to stand on), sub-stance, foundation
	- $T_1$: what to trust in, what to hope for, a positive or forward mindset
- $S_2$: [the Socratic method for analyzing and refuting an argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method), the process of falsifying a hypothesis, the scrutiny
	- $T_2$: deeds, acts, matters, affairs, practices
    - $T_3$: what not being seen, what in secret

<p/>

#### Additionally,

We also do a forward and reverse scan over the next few verses to get a sense of context. In the example below, I rearranged the phrases to flow better while trying to preserve as much of the original Greek meaning:
<blockquote style='color:green;font-size:1em;padding:0 0.75em;margin-left:2em'>
<p>
... For in it [faith], the elders/patriarchs were commended. By faith, we understand that the ages have been made by the spoken words of God, so that which is not visible gives rise to the things that we can see...
</p>
</blockquote>

### Observations & Notes

In this verse, the parallel is drawn between the two symbols $S_1$ and $S_2$ while $T_i$ are their modifiers. The word "faith" itself is part of a leading phrase. It is tempting to draw a parallel between "faith" and "work" here, but that's not the right way to read this verse as shown in the graph above.

Given the fact that the original text was written in Koine Greek, it made sense to me that -- with historical context far removed -- a translation should stay close to the meaning of the root components of the Greek words. This is the baseline that reduces a large amount of uncertainty. Using this method, I was able to parse out a translation that I believe to be in spirit with the rest of the letter.

On the other hand, I struggled the most to find an associative meaning that is appropriate for the word $\acute{\epsilon}\lambda\epsilon\gamma\chi{o}\varsigma$ (elegkhos).

The English translations (that I have checked) all try (and fail) to use a single English word to capture the meaning of the original Greek word. This is problematic, because English historically is an *impure* Germanic language that was mixed up multiple times with Latin, Greek and French. Without proper context, the meaning of a word is completely arbitrary. This is an example of the limitation of a purely textual approach, i.e. *sola scriptura*, which I condemn as a stubborn attempt to "box" the words of the LORD.

Symbols are amorphous by their abstract nature, which is caused by the fact that they are *induced* with meanings from many contexts. This often causes unintended ambiguity. However, if mapped out as clusters, the word usages and contexts should aggregate around some common centers. This is because language is first and foremost a map of reality, on top of being a self-referential construct (Wittgenstein). Assuming this as foundation, we proceed with the next step of reasoning.

St. Paul was a highly educated (Hellenic) Roman citizen and a member of the Sanhedrin. On the other hand, *oration* -- or public speaking -- is the *de facto* form of thinking and public discourse among educated Hellenics. It's their inheritance from ancient Greece, of which the Socratic method is a core technique. Therefore, it is plausible to me that he should have been aware of this method and presumed this meaning of the word.
$$
\acute{\epsilon}\lambda\epsilon\gamma\chi{o}\varsigma = \text{elegkhos: the Socratic method}
$$

<p/>

Finally, we must also remind ourselves of the content and audience of this letter: Judean Christians in Jerusalem, who were living under severe persecution at the time. Paul himself had been one of the harshest persecutors until his journey to Damascus. In this letter, he reminded his brothers and sisters of the continuation between the Old and New Sacrifices and thus ultimately steadfast obedience in the LORD despite persecution.


### Translation

<blockquote style='color:green;font-size:1em;padding:0 0.75em;margin-left:2em'>
<p>
Now, faith is the foundation we trust in, and (faith is) the private scrutiny of our own actions.
</p>
</blockquote>

1. In short,
- faith is the foundation in the LORD through Scriptures
- it is the private scrutiny of our own actions regardless of hard times

2. In long,
- faith is the understanding that:
    - what the prophets spoke of were worthy of being recorded and collated into Scriptures,
    - all of which were fulfilled and pointed to the Son of Man in Jesus the Christ.
- faith calls for the proof of internal consistency through self-reflection.
    - we need to show our trust by ensuring that our actions are in accordance with the LORD's teaching (Matthew 6:3-8).

### Final Thoughts

All of this is actually just an excuse for me to write.

Personally, I am reading this verse in the context of my current professional situation. It's been very difficult this year for a lot of people in the field of IT, myself included. People got laid off in massive numbers, who then flooded the market and made it extremely hard for new grads to compete for even an entry level position. I myself sent out about 600 application in the Summer of 2023, and I have seen someone automating 10,000 applications. It's just insane.

It is a very tough time for sure.

At a time like this, I know and want to remind myself that it is very important to stay focused. If I don't receive what I want today, I should not be discouraged. It boils down to "a skill issue", which means that my current skills are unable to stand up to extreme scrutiny. And because it is "a skill issue", it can be corrected.

Only the skills that have been scrutinized in secret today will become the ground on which I can stand in confidence tomorrow.

I need to continue to work.
