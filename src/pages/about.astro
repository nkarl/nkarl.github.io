    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
    <p>I am looking for opportunities to build up my skills in functional
      programming. I have studied PureScript and algebraic structures for the past 6 months,
      up to and including transformers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am targeting web development projects that use
      statically-typed languages such as PureScript, Haskell, Scala or OCaml. I
      am also looking for projects where SQL is part of the stack.

            I worked with the engineering team to rebuild an existing website
            previously written in React TypeScript and deployed with Google
            Cloud Functions. Our work was done using the TypeScript, Java, NoSQL
            stack. We developed and deployed on GCP.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first 3 months we worked to boot up and stabilize the Java
            backend. We separated the logic into a proper Java SpringBoot
            backend with ORM for the Firebase database. This <strong

                from 4s to below 1s</em
              ></strong>. In the final 3 months, I contributed to the next phase of the
            development cycle with outreach interviews to collect and analyze
            user feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            Near the end of my tenure, I also started working on refactoring the frontend,
            which propmted me to learn dig deeper into functional programming.

            I worked in Prof. Venera Arnaoudova's lab and contributed to a
            larger body of research into measuring the cognitive load of developers during
            heavy programming tasks. This research hopes to develop tools that
            might better assist developers.

            My partner Shira Feinberg and I
            scheduled appointments, conducted and monitored experiments, performed participant exit interviews, and
            automated data cleanup and organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also reviewed the source code of the companion ReactNative app
            (developed by the previous cohort of assistants) which maps and
            projects eye-tracker coordinates as a heat map over web content.

          I worked with the WSU College of Education to introduce basic programming concepts to
          students at a Lincoln Middle School, Pullman WA. I worked through two week-long programming camps, one virtual and one in-person.
          I walked the students through the basic syntax and semantics of Python.
          </p>
          <p>We accompany the theory with a small fun project: building a snake game.
          Some of the kids were really into the decorations! :)
