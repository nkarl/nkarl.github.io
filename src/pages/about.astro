    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
      I am looking for opportunities to build up my skills in functional
      programming. I am targeting web development projects that use
      statically-typed languages such as PureScript, Haskell, Scala or OCaml. I
      am also looking for projects where SQL is part of the stack.

            I worked with the engineering team to rebuild an existing website
            previously written in React TypeScript and deployed with Google
            Cloud Functions. Our work was done using the TypeScript, Java, NoSQL
            stack. We deployed the main branch on GCP.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first 3 months we worked to boot up and stabilize the Java
            backend. We separated the logic into a proper Java SpringBoot
            backend with ORM for the Firebase database. This <strong

              ></strong
            >. In the last 3 months, I contributed to the next phase of the
            development cycle with outreach interviews to collect and analyze
            user feedback.

            I worked in Prof. Venera Arnaoudova's lab and contributed to a
            larger body of research into the cognitive load of developers during
            heavy programming tasks. This research hopes to develop tools that
            might better assist developers. My partner Shira Feinberg and I
            scheduled appointments, performed participant interviews and
            automated data cleanup and organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also reviewed the source code of the companion ReactNative app
            (developed by the previous cohort of assistants) which maps and
            projects eye-tracker coordinates as a heat map over web content.
