    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
      <p>
        I have 2 year of experience of full stack web development, having worked
        with most layers â€” from user-facing to back-end and CI/CD.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment I focus on the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, which in my
        opinion has the best transaction model. I aim to develop Plutus smart
        contracts and apps that can help solve the economic identity problem
        for many.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am open to long and short-term contracts at any layer of the web stack
        (preferably with a SQL database). I also welcome opportunities that let
        me use a functional language in-/outside of the Haskell-family,
        including Scala or OCaml.

            I continue to write code and contribute to open source and community

            I helped rebuilding an existing web application that connects and
            facilitates mentorship booking. Our work was done using the
            TypeScript, Java, NoSQL stack. We developed and deployed on GCP.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first 3 months we worked to boot up and stabilize the Java
            back-end. We separated the core booking logic into a proper Java
            SpringBoot back-end with ORM for the Firebase database.
            <strong>
              <em>
                This let us identify and remove a bottleneck, which resulted in
                a 4s reduction in load time.

          </p>
          <p>
            In the final 3 months, I contributed to the next phase of the SDLC
            with outreach interviews to collect and analyze user feedback. Near
            the end of my time there, I started working on refactoring and
            adding Jest unit tests to the React front-end.

            I worked in Prof. Venera Arnaoudova's lab and contributed to a
            larger body of research into measuring the cognitive load of
            developers during heavy programming tasks. This research hopes to
            develop tools that might better assist developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My partner Shira Feinberg and I scheduled appointments, conducted
            and monitored experiments, performed participant exit interviews,
            and automated data cleanup and organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also reviewed the source code of the companion ReactNative app
            (developed by the previous cohort of assistants) which maps and
            projects eye-tracker coordinates as a heat map over web content. It
            was like looking at gibberish, which prompted me to learn JavaScript
            and web development.

          I worked with the WSU College of Education to introduce basic
          programming concepts to students at Lincoln Middle School, Pullman WA.
          I taught in both the virtual and in-person camps, each 2-week long. I
          walked the students through the basic syntax and semantics of Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          We helped the students retain knowledge by building small project: a
          snake game project set up in Replit. Some kids really went to town
          with decorating the snake and the arena!
